#: Scrollback {{{

# scrollback_lines 2000

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down performance of the terminal and
#: also use large amounts of RAM. Instead, consider using
#: scrollback_pager_history_size. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

# scrollbar scrolled

#: Control when the scrollbar is displayed.

#: scrolled
#:     means when the scrolling backwards has started.
#: hovered
#:     means when the mouse is hovering on the right edge of the window.
#: scrolled-and-hovered
#:     means when the mouse is over the scrollbar region *and* scrolling backwards has started.
#: always
#:     means whenever any scrollback is present
#: never
#:     means disable the scrollbar.

# scrollbar_interactive yes

#: If disabled, the scrollbar will not be controllable via th emouse
#: and all mouse events will pass through the scrollbar.

# scrollbar_jump_on_click yes

#: When enabled clicking in the scrollbar track will cause the scroll
#: position to jump to the clicked location, otherwise the scroll
#: position will only move towards the position by a single screenful,
#: which is how traditional scrollbars behave.

# scrollbar_width 0.5

#: The width of the scroll bar in units of cell width.

# scrollbar_hover_width 1

#: The width of the scroll bar when the mouse is hovering over it, in
#: units of cell width.

# scrollbar_handle_opacity 0.5

#: The opacity of the scrollbar handle, 0 being fully transparent and
#: 1 being full opaque.

# scrollbar_radius 0.3

#: The radius (curvature) of the scrollbar handle in units of cell
#: width. Should be less than scrollbar_width.

# scrollbar_gap 0.1

#: The gap between the scrollbar and the window edge in units of cell
#: width.

# scrollbar_min_handle_height 1

#: The minimum height of the scrollbar handle in units of cell height.
#: Prevents the handle from becoming too small when there is a lot of
#: scrollback.

# scrollbar_hitbox_expansion 0.25

#: The extra area around the handle to allow easier grabbing of the
#: scollbar in units of cell width.

# scrollbar_track_opacity 0

#: The opacity of the scrollbar track, 0 being fully transparent and 1
#: being full opaque.

# scrollbar_track_hover_opacity 0.1

#: The opacity of the scrollbar track when the mouse is over the
#: scrollbar, 0 being fully transparent and 1 being full opaque.

# scrollbar_handle_color foreground

#: The color of the scrollbar handle. A value of foreground means to
#: use the current foreground text color, a value of
#: selection_background means to use the current selection background
#: color. Also, you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or
#: red.

# scrollbar_track_color foreground

#: The color of the scrollbar track. A value of foreground means to
#: use the current foreground text color, a value of
#: selection_background means to use the current selection background
#: color. Also, you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or
#: red.

# scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen. Similarly CURSOR_LINE and
#: CURSOR_COLUMN will be replaced by the current cursor position or
#: set to 0 if there is no cursor, for example, when showing the last
#: command output.

#: If you would rather use neovim to view the scrollback, use
#: something like this::

#:     scrollback_pager nvim --cmd 'set eventignore=FileType' +'nnoremap q ZQ' +'call nvim_open_term(0, {})' +'set nomodified nolist' +'$' -

#: The above works for neovim 0.12 and newer. There is also a
#: dedicated plugin kitty-scrollback.nvim
#: <https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim> you can use
#: with more features that works with older neovim as well.

# scrollback_pager_history_size 0

#: Separate scrollback history size (in MB), used only for browsing
#: the scrollback buffer with pager. This separate buffer is not
#: available for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager
#: program when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The
#: current implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so approximately
#: 10000 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII,
#: unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature.
#: The maximum allowed size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

# scrollback_fill_enlarged_window no

#: Fill new space with lines from the scrollback buffer after
#: enlarging a window.

# wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

#: Multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel.
#: Note that this is only used for low precision scrolling devices,
#: not for high precision scrolling devices on platforms such as macOS
#: and Wayland. Use negative numbers to change scroll direction. See
#: also wheel_scroll_min_lines.

# wheel_scroll_min_lines 1

#: The minimum number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel. The scroll
#: multiplier wheel_scroll_multiplier only takes effect after it
#: reaches this number. Note that this is only used for low precision
#: scrolling devices like wheel mice that scroll by very small amounts
#: when using the wheel. With a negative number, the minimum number of
#: lines will always be added.

# touch_scroll_multiplier 1.0

#: Multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by a touchpad. Note
#: that this is only used for high precision scrolling devices on
#: platforms such as macOS and Wayland. Use negative numbers to change
#: scroll direction.
